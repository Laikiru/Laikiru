I'm currently a student at CSULB majoring in Creative Writing. I enjoy skateboarding, watching anime, making art, and playing video games! I'd love to try and put my creative endeavors into something that other people can enjoy and use, like video games and applications, hence why I want to learn programming. 
Also just because it's pretty cool.
